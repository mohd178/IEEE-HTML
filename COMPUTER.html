    <td>coding</td>
    <td> Coding is the act of writing code in various programming languages to instruct computers on how to perform tasks. It serves as a bridge between human ideas and machine execution</td>

    <td>high-level language</td>
    <td>A high-level language is a programming language that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. It abstracts away much of the complexity of the underlying hardware, allowing programmers to focus on problem-solving and algorithm development rather than on the details of the computer's architecture.</td>
